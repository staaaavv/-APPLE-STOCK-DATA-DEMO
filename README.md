---

##  Workflow

### 1. Data Source
- **Yahoo Finance API** via [`yfinance`](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)  
- All data are **public market data** (no personal information is used)

### 2. Data Preparation
- Retrieve 2-year historical OHLCV data  
- Add fundamental data: financials, balance sheet, cashflow  
- Handle missing values (forward fill)  
- Remove duplicates and invalid (negative) entries  
- Convert dates to ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)

### 3. Feature Engineering
Calculated using [`ta`](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
- **SMA_20**: Simple Moving Average (20-day)
- **EMA_20**: Exponential Moving Average (20-day)
- **RSI_14**: Relative Strength Index (14-day)
- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- **Return**: Daily % change of closing price

### 4. Validation
- Checks for missing or negative values  
- Detection of extreme daily changes (>10%)  
- Cross-checks against Yahoo Finance for data integrity

### 5. Visualization
Line charts showing:
- Close Price  
- SMA 20  
- EMA 20  
- Highlighted spikes (>10% daily return)

- Aggregated statistics (mean, std, min, max)  
- Table of extreme daily returns (>10%)  
- Ready for documentation or presentation
